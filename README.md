# Raith_Robotics_ws
This is the Live Project I have done for industrial Input for a Robotics Company. The Repository consists of core Robotics Concepts that are used for the product based development by the Robotics company.The Software part is done with traditional ROS neotic and usual Gazebo simulation with Moveit based practices. 
The Project main application is to use Object Detection or Point Cloud Data to distinguish an object on the Table and need to Pick and place to other table such that the picking of an Object is done holding exactly on the Centroid of an object. 
Also, this centroid need to be found by mathematical models when Point Cloud Clustering is being Done. 
The Robot used here is Universal Robot 5(UR5) with Robotiq_2f85 gripper attached as an end effector.
This repository need to be used according to the your workspace in ros neotic ubuntu 20.04. Please make Sure to do it after Downloading repository like changing all the names in the files.
